# Autonomous Drone With IOS App Repository

The purpose of this project is to build a drone with certain autonomous capabilites as well as an IOS app to control the drone. The idea is to enable the user to set automatic drone flights with a single button from an IOS app. The drone will then perform the automatic flight along with the picture or videos wanted by the user.
